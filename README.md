Exam Cheat Sheets

Feel free to use this skeleton to customize your own cheat sheet.

A few notes:
1. This cheat sheet assumes a sufficient understanding of the material. It may skip trivial definitions or proofs.
2. I only hard-code practice problems when I think their result is critical.
3. For definite integrals, $$\int$$ implies $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}$$. For sums, $$\sum$$ implies $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}$$ or $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$$.
4. To save space, $$\sin$$ and $$\cos$$ may be abbreviated as s and c, respectively.
5. Additional comments are in the `.tex` file to highlight critical details.
6. In the `.tex` file, I abbreviate frequently used symbols and commands.
7. Currently, the columns and pages are not well-organized due to my limited LaTeX skills :(

Good luck!
